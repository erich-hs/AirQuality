# AirQuality
The current project describes and analyzes a dataset of six years of air pollution monitoring in the city of Ho Chi Minh. The data was screened and cleaned for performing statistical description and inferential analysis with tools such as box plots and scatter plots and correlation analysis for numerical and categorical data. Finally, a set of t-tests were performed in order to determine if the lockdown due to Covid-19 in 2020 had an impact on air pollution in the city; at the same time, external data for the cities of London and Beijing were used to execute statistical tests, deliver conclusions, comparisons and to make suggestions. All the analyses were performed in SAS University Edition.
